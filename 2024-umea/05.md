## Workflows

DARIAH sees today a priority in describing digital humanities workflows in the SSHOP. This is why:
- The DARIAH Annual Event 2024 was devoted to the topic of "Workflows: Digital Methods for Reproducible Research Practices in the Arts and Humanities". You may find the conference proceedings [here](https://zenodo.org/communities/dariahannualevent2024-workflows/).
- The DARIAH WG Bibliographical Data has recently published some workflows in the SSHOP. See [here](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.12580109).  
- The DARIAH Multilingual DH and Research Data Management organised in August 2024 the workshop ["Creating Managing and Archiving Textual Corpora in Under-resourced Languages"](https://gitlab-ce.rrz.uni-hamburg.de/uahh-digitale-dienste/creating-managing-and-archiving-textual-corpora), which led to the creation of some workflows too.
