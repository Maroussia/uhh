SSHOP - The Social Sciences & Humanities Open Marketplace

The [Social Sciences & Humanities Open Marketplace](https://marketplace.sshopencloud.eu/) is a discovery portal which lists and hosts resources for Social Sciences and Humanities research: tools, services, training materials, datasets, publications and workflows.  
It showcases solutions and research practices for every step of the research data life cycle. It is maintained by three European Research Infrastructures (ERICs): DARIAH, CLARIN, and CESSDA. You can both search for content and add new items, which will be published after a quality control. You can log in by using your academic credentials or your ORCID.  

DARIAH sees today a priority in describing digital humanities workflows. This is why:
- DARIAH Annual Event 2024 was devoted to the topic of "of Workflows: Digital Methods for Reproducible Research Practices in the Arts and Humanities". You may find the conference proceedings [here](https://zenodo.org/communities/dariahannualevent2024-workflows/)
- DARIAH Working Groups Bibliographical Data, Multilingual DH and Research Data Management published some workflows in the SSHOP. See [here](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.12580109) for the former, and [here](https://gitlab-ce.rrz.uni-hamburg.de/uahh-digitale-dienste/creating-managing-and-archiving-textual-corpora) for the two latter.
