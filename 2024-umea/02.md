Social Sciences & Humanities Open Marketplace (https://marketplace.sshopencloud.eu/), so that participants can search there for tools, workflows and datasets of their interest, and to the  DARIAH Consent Form Wizard (https://consent.dariah.eu/), wherein participants can approach the topic of GDPR in humanities research.
I will also be happy to point to DARIAH working groups (https://www.dariah.eu/activities/working-groups/), which participants can join, to dariahTeach (Open Educational Resources for the Digital Arts & Humanities: https://teach.dariah.eu/) and to DARIAH Campus (https://campus.dariah.eu/).
