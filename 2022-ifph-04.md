Then, archivists will have to make these records and their descriptive metadata accessible. Metadata will be accessible with no restrictions, whether archival legislation may foresee a non-disclosure period or a period of restricted access. Long-term archiving should take place in the context of the ISO Standard OAIS (Open Archival Information System: https://www.iso.org/standard/57284.html).

Records and metadata should be findable too. A good option to be adopted is the Open Archives Initiative (http://www.openarchives.org/) in order to make descriptions of archival holdings contained in online catalogues digitally harvestable, interoperable and freely (re)usable.

Thank you very much for your attention,
