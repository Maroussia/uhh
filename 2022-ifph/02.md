As long as preservation of digital archival records is concerned, it is vital that archives-producing institutions and individuals adopt good digital practices from the very creation of the record. A member of a marginalised community or an independent scholar may record evidence of e.g. violence or oppression. This evidence, which is worth preserving, is an archival record in spe. Of course, these non-affiliated individuals will not be provided with professional services in the fields of IT risk management, data curation and data quality. It is moreover unlikely that they could afford such services on their own. 
Yet lack of IT and IS (information science) support reduces drastically chances that these digital records (e.g. audiovisual material or written documents) will be available and accessible in the middle term.
