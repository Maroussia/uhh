## DARIAH

Since 2014, [DARIAH](https://www.dariah.eu/) (Digital Research Infrastructure for Arts and Humanities) has been the pan-European, interdisciplinary research infrastructure for all humanities scholars who work digitally.  
Sweden, represented by Huminfra, became in August 2024 DARIAH's 22nd member country; see [here](https://www.dariah.eu/2024/08/26/sweden-joins-dariah-as-full-member/).
