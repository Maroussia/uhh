## DARIAH Working Groups: Grassroots Research

DARIAH has almost 30 [working groups](https://www.dariah.eu/activities/working-groups/) (WGs), open to everybody. Many of them are interdisciplinary, like WGs [Research Data Management](https://www.dariah.eu/activities/working-groups/research-data-management/) and [Multilingual DH](https://www.dariah.eu/activities/working-groups/multilingual-dh/).
In the WGs, grassroots research takes place in the form of community building, exchange of best practices, implementation of smaller research projects, dissemination.
