## The SSHOP - Social Sciences & Humanities Open Marketplace

The [Social Sciences & Humanities Open Marketplace](https://marketplace.sshopencloud.eu/) is a discovery portal which lists and hosts resources for Social Sciences and Humanities research: tools, services, training materials, datasets, publications and workflows.  
It is maintained by three European Research Infrastructures (ERICs): DARIAH, CLARIN, and CESSDA. You can both search for content and add new items, which will be published after a quality control.   
You can log in by using your academic credentials or your ORCID.
